Discord Bots are a simple way of making servers more fun. However, many of them use a coin or currency based system to provide various features. For example; Dank Memer coins from the Dank Memer bot. In order to mine acquire these coins members have to perform certain command based acions. Sometimes multiple times in order to get a sufficient amount of currency/coins.
So here's a simple bot I've made to help automate the process of mining such coins on your Discord server.

**How to Use:**
1. Download the .exe file from Releases
2. Run the .exe file
3. Enter upto 5 different commands that you would like the bot to type out
4. Right click on the message entry box within Discord
5. Thats it!, the bot will keep repeating the commands one by one every five seconds until stopped
    Press and Hold the 'Shift' key for 5 Seconds in order to stop the bot

**Warning**
Repeatedly using this bot may result in your account being banned. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any accounts terminated or banned due to the use of this automation program.
